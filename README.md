# Active-Learning-for-Histopathology-and-Whole-Slide-Images
This repo contains the implementation of an active learning strategy explored in the domain of Whole Slide Images. The proposed strategy achieves the state of the art results with limited amount of labelled data (5%). The proposed technique does this in an interactive setting without needing any labelled data upfront. We further show that the proposed technique is also useful in annotating tumorous regions of large sized WSIs with minimum expert involvement. 

The work was published with the title **"Interactive Learning for Assisting Whole Slide Image Annotation"** in the oral section of ACPR2021 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-02444-3_38

Instructions on running the code: run the respective shell script to implement the work on the two datasets reported in the paper. Each shell script has the discussed strategies.
