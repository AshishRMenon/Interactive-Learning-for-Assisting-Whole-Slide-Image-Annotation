# Active-Learning-for-Histopathology-and-Whole-Slide-Images
This repo contains the implementation of an active learning strategy explored in the domain of Whole Slide Images. The proposed strategy achieves the state of the art results with limited amount of labelled data (5%). The proposed technique does this in an interactive setting without needing any labelled data upfront. We further show that the proposed technique is also useful in annotating tumorous regions of large sized WSIs with minimum expert involvement. 

The work was published in the oral section of ACPR2021 and will be made available soon.
